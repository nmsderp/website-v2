        <ctitle>ways to hiss</ctitle>
        <p>
          ways to hiss is a game i made just for the point of putting on my
          website. it was one of my first games and has been on my website since
          early 2023, so i'm keeping it. it was made with penguinmod.

        <ctitle>snail ide</ctitle>
        <p>
          snail ide is a mod of (early) penguinmod that adds more extensions and
          vm features. i created the website for it, but nms works on the
          editor.

      <div id="zenscriptdesc" class="card" style="display:none;">
        <ctitle>zenscript</ctitle>
        <p>
          zenscript was a very bad programming language i made with python. it
          was meant to convert its shitty syntax into html.
